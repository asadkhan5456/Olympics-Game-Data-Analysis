## Data Story

### Aim & Goal

- **Aim**: Analyze historical Olympic data to identify key trends in athlete participation, medal distribution, and demographics.

- **Goal**: Provide clear visual insights into how the Olympics have evolved over time across countries, genders, ages, and events.

### Problem Statement

Understanding the progression and disparities in Olympic participation and performance over time can guide sports federations, policymakers, and researchers in making data-driven decisions. This project addresses the need for a thorough statistical overview of Olympic Games data.

### Our Approach

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**:

- Load athlete_events.csv and noc_regions.csv from Kaggle.

- Merge datasets and clean missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

- Visualize participation trends by country and gender.

- Examine age and gender distributions among athletes.

- Analyze medal counts and identify standout performances.

- Explore body metrics (height vs. weight) of medalists.

3. **Visualization & Insights**:

- Generate bar plots, line charts, histograms, and scatter plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- Highlight key findings and demographic patterns.
